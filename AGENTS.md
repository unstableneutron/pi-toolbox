## Code exploration — prefer `ast-outline` over full reads

For `.cs`, `.cpp`, `.cc`, `.cxx`, `.h`, `.hpp`, `.hh`, `.py`, `.pyi`,
`.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx`, `.java`, `.kt`, `.kts`, `.scala`, `.sc`,
`.go`, `.rs`, `.php`, `.phtml`, `.rb`, `.rake`, `.gemspec`, `.lua`,
`.gd`, `.swift`, `.css`, `.scss`, `.sql`, `.html`, `.htm`, `.md`, and
`.yaml`/`.yml` files, read structure with `ast-outline` before opening
full contents.

Pick the smallest of these that answers your question — they're a
broad-to-narrow menu, not a sequence; skip straight to `show` when
you already know the symbol:

1. **Unfamiliar directory** — `ast-outline digest <paths…>`: one-page map
   of every file's types and public methods. Each file is tagged with a
   size label — `[tiny]` / `[medium]` / `[large]` / `[huge]` — plus
   `[broken]` when parse errors may have left the outline partial.
   `[huge]` files (≥100k tokens) collapse to header-only in the digest;
   call `ast-outline outline <path>` on them when you need full structure.
   Tune density with `--format=names|compact|default|wide` (alias
   `--oneline`=`names`) — `wide` adds private members and fields.

2. **File-level shape** — `ast-outline <paths…>`: signatures with line
   ranges, no bodies (2–10× smaller than a full read on non-trivial
   files). A `# WARNING: N parse errors` line in the header means the
   outline is partial — read the source for the affected region.

3. **One method, type, markdown heading, or yaml key** —
   `ast-outline show <file> <Symbol>`. Suffix matching: `TakeDamage`
   for one method; `User` for an entire type — class, struct, interface,
   trait, enum (whole body, useful when a file holds several types);
   `Player.TakeDamage` when ambiguous. Multiple at once:
   `ast-outline show Player.cs TakeDamage Heal Die`.
   For markdown, the symbol is heading text and matching is
   case-insensitive substring — `"installation"` finds
   `"2.1 Installation (macOS / Linux)"`. For yaml, the symbol is a
   dotted key path (`spec.containers[0].image`) — `show` matches keys,
   not values, so for free-text search inside values use `grep`.
   For css/scss, the symbol is a selector token (`.btn-primary`,
   `$var`) — pseudos and attribute filters are stripped, so
   `.btn-primary` finds the rule even when it carries `:hover` or
   nests in `.modal`.
   For html, the symbol is a CSS-selector token (`#hero`, `.site-nav`,
   `form`, `section#hero`, `[rel=stylesheet]`) — same vocabulary as
   css/scss; pseudo-classes and descendant combinators aren't
   supported (use the tag/id/class/attribute form the outline shows).
   For sql, the symbol is a table or column name (`users`,
   `users.email`) — `show users` returns the table definition,
   `show users.email` returns one column line.
   Add `--signature` to `show` (only there) to return header only
   (docs + attrs + signature, no body) — useful after `digest`, when
   you have the name and want the contract, not the implementation.

4. **Where a symbol appears** —
   `ast-outline grep <pattern> <paths…>`: matches grouped by enclosing
   class/function. Definitions are tagged `[def]`, imports `[import]`;
   calls and refs carry no tag (inferable from `(` after symbol).
   Use for "where is X defined", "who calls Y", "is Z dead code" —
   scope in the output spares follow-up reads. Comments filtered;
   string literals searched and tagged `[string]`, so config keys,
   translation strings and reflection targets are found too. Batch
   via repeatable `-e`:
   `ast-outline grep User.save -e User.load -e User.delete src/`.
   Narrow by classification with `--kind def|call|ref|import` (also
   accepts `--kind def,call`) — drops the post-filter step when you
   only want definitions, only call sites, etc.
   POSIX flags `-w` (whole word), `-l` (paths only), `-c` (counts),
   `-m N` (cap per file) work as in `grep` / `rg`. For non-symbol
   patterns use your default search strategy.

`outline` and `digest` accept multiple paths in one call (files and
directories, mixed languages OK) — batch instead of looping. Type
headers in both renderers carry inheritance as `: Base, Trait`, so the
shape of class hierarchies is visible without a separate query.

The renderers emit a compact skeleton (signatures + line ranges, no
bodies), so output is usually small — narrow with the tool's own flags
before piping to `head`. A `grep | head` cut is the costly one: it
hides matches the header still counts in `(N matches)`, so results look
complete but aren't — cap per file with `-m N` instead.

Narrow the walk with repeatable `--exclude <glob>`
(`.gitignore`-syntax, anchored at the project root) on `outline` /
`digest` / `grep` — e.g. `--exclude tests/ --exclude '*.gen.*'` to
skip test trees and generated files in one call. `!pattern` negates;
`.gitignore` is still honored by default — `--exclude` adds to it.

When you need to know **what a file pulls in** or **where a referenced
type / function comes from**, add `--imports` to `outline` or `digest`.
The file header gets an `imports:` line listing every
`import` / `use` / `using` statement verbatim in the language's native
syntax — `from .core import X`, `use foo::Bar`,
`import { X } from './foo'`, `use App\Foo`, `require_once 'config.php'`,
`require "json"`.
Read the imports, then call `outline` / `show` on the source file
instead of grepping for the definition. Skip the flag for routine
structure reads — it adds one line per file.

A trailing `[+ N conditional includes]` on the imports line means
N more dependencies live inside `if` / `try` / loop / function bodies
— read the file directly when you need the full dependency picture.

Fall back to a full read only when you need context beyond the body
`show` returned. `ast-outline help` for flags.
